![hello from nine](https://github.com/neozeed/nine/assets/9031439/2ce26e34-c1f8-4178-b67f-f6d7189f0d6f)

This is a sad fork of 2ine, something done by people far smarter than me.

I don't like cmake and had too many issues trying to build this,
so I just captured the output and made a really poor makefile.

On my 64bit machine hello builds and runs, so I guess that's something.
